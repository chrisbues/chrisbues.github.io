This example is a variable length number with no other formatting, and no padding. This is fairly common, especially with mixed MRN systems.\n127528819: 6-9 digits\nThe corresponding regex to find this MRN is this:\n\\b\\d{6,9}\\b The custom SIT definition looks like this:\nPattern #1\nConfidence: High Regular Expression: \\b\\d{6,9}\\b Character proximity: 300 characters (default) Supporting elements: case insensitive keywords MRN, Medical Record Number, Record Number Pattern #2\nConfidence: Low Regular Expression: \\b\\d{6,9}\\b Character proximity: 300 characters (default) Supporting elements: none Test Data Our test data is a simple, fake extract from a MRN system. Note that MRN is the first column, and the column name is one of our keywords (mrn).\n\"mrn\",\"firstname\",\"lastname\",\"dob\",\"address\",\"city\",\"state\",\"zip\",\"phone\",\"email\" \"492338213\",\"Kelly\",\"Pratt\",\"2001-09-28\",\"80947 Nelson Estates Apt. 763\",\"Kathyfort\",\"HI\",\"66442\",\"+1-578-586-3745x48021\",\"wking@example.com\" \"789241276\",\"John\",\"Arnold\",\"1955-10-28\",\"03741 Sanchez Shore\",\"South Anthonyview\",\"MN\",\"56561\",\"+1-988-725-1788x1975\",\"michael33@example.org\" \"719643833\",\"Steven\",\"Wilson\",\"1948-06-19\",\"341 Brooks Courts\",\"Lake Candiceside\",\"ND\",\"92691\",\"001-933-368-7396x72128\",\"yclark@example.net\" \"913581370\",\"Laura\",\"Mitchell\",\"1951-11-25\",\"8421 Kelley Islands Suite 633\",\"Kramerfort\",\"NM\",\"30252\",\"760.462.3509x7056\",\"shawn66@example.org\" \"175729777\",\"Sean\",\"Lewis\",\"1943-11-17\",\"3140 Hunt Track Apt. 116\",\"Jamesview\",\"CO\",\"86702\",\"001-964-653-2716x1838\",\"aliciawilson@example.net\" \"76761344\",\"Paul\",\"Booth\",\"1936-09-17\",\"3297 Juan Field Apt. 857\",\"Tanyafurt\",\"MT\",\"80739\",\"358.612.7934x4561\",\"victoriawilson@example.com\" \"286086254\",\"Samantha\",\"Pham\",\"2018-08-23\",\"600 Kimberly Glen Suite 866\",\"Lake Alexanderville\",\"NE\",\"64307\",\"350-511-9743x968\",\"michael35@example.net\" \"949601932\",\"Ethan\",\"Berry\",\"1933-02-14\",\"2593 Sandoval Pine\",\"Traceyside\",\"IA\",\"79382\",\"+1-682-236-0383x226\",\"natasha45@example.org\" \"206072596\",\"Sharon\",\"Davis\",\"2004-12-03\",\"444 Mark Station Apt. 787\",\"Lake Matthewville\",\"GU\",\"87599\",\"482.353.2044x885\",\"christine42@example.com\" \"586966326\",\"Patricia\",\"Roberts\",\"1952-01-18\",\"9939 Jones Flats\",\"Sullivanbury\",\"MT\",\"41356\",\"969-900-3288x749\",\"silvaronald@example.com\" Testing the SIT Running this test data though the tester on the SIT definition, and you’ll get something along the lines of this:\nLow - 10 unique matches\nMatches Supporting Elements 206072596 - 286086254 - 492338213 “mrn” 789241276 “mrn” 76761344 - 949601932 - 719643833 - 175729777 - 913581370 - 586966326 - High - 2 unique matches\nMatches Supporting Elements 492338213 “mrn” 789241276 “mrn” So why did the high only match two? Proximity. Think of CSVs as long run-on sentences. In our test data data above, 300 characters from “mrn” in the first line is around the middle of the third line. In our test data, MRNs that would match are highlighted in green, and those that are 300+ characters away from mrn in the first row won’t match because of the distance between the actual MRN and the keyword mrn.","relaxing-proximity#Relaxing proximity":"This technique, featured on the Compliance CxE site , creates an custom SIT with settings that will increase matches by assuming that if there are 9 or more low confidence matches without keywords then those will be counted as high confidence as long as there are high confidence matches as well of the same type. This works well for table based data, where it’s generally safe to assume that the column contains data that matches.\nIn our example from above, our green MRNs are high, and the red MRNs will also be assumed to be high.","techniques#Techniques":"There are multiple ways to deal with this issue."},"title":"SITs for Table-based Data"}}
