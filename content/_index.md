title: 'Welcome to my Digital Garden'
---

[This page](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up) on Ness Labs succinctly summarizes what a "Digital Garden" is
> A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public. Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes.

I've always struggled with *what* to take notes in. I landed on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) a while back, and used it for some time. I've been slowly gravitating away from it to just writing in plain Markdown in VSCode, which of course turned into, "hey, let's change my whole website around". Well, that's where you're at currently. More to come obviously.
